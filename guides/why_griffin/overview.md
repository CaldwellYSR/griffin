# Griffin is an Elixir static site generator
Griffin takes advantage of all of your CPU-cores to generate static websites quickly.
It aims to be the Elixir alternative to popular generators like **[11ty][11ty]** or **[hugo][hugo]**.

* Griffin was made to **feel familiar to Elixir developers.**
It uses the same `mix` based installer as [Phoenix][phoenix], which will make
Elixir web developers feel right at home.

* Griffin is **not competing with Phoenix.**
Griffin was created to make it easier to build static websites,
where none of Phoenix's flagship features are relevant.

* Griffin uses **independent template languages.**
Despite being an Elixir tool, content is written in Markdown with YAML
front matter to allow easier migrations to or from Griffin.

* Griffin is **simple to use.**
We lower the barrier to entry by using sensible defaults
and minimizing the amount of configuration needed to set up a Griffin website.

* Griffin is **built by the community.**
This is a new project that is still in active development.
