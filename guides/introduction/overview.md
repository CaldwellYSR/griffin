# Overview

Griffin is a tool for building static websites from simple text files. Among many competitors, Griffin aims to be the preferred tool for Erlang and Elixir developers and its development follows two core values: simplicity and productivity.

To get started, an introductory knowledge of Elixir is helpful. If you aren't familiar with Elixir, the [official guides](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html) and the [Elixir learning resources page](https://elixir-lang.org/learning.html) are great starter resources.

These guides provide an overview into the components that are part of Griffin. Here's a list of the pages in these guides:

- Introduction: the guide you are currently reading. It will cover how to start your first Griffin website and how to build and deploy it.
- Guides: in-depth guides covering the main components in Griffin and Griffin projects

Alternatively, this documentation is also provided in [epub format](Griffin.epub).

Since Griffin is in active development, these guides may be out of date or incomplete. We make documentation a top priority and we welcome improvements to it. If you wish to contribute, please [open an issue](https://github.com/elixir-griffin/griffin/issues/new) on the Griffin repository, making sure to follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/elixir-griffin/griffin/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
